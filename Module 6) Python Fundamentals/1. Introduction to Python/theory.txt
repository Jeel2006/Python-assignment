1). Introduction to Python and its Features (simple, high-level, interpreted language). 
	Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.  
	->>Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development. 
	->>Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and 
	code reuse.  
	->>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be 		freely distributed. 
	->>Features
		simple - 
			- Clean, clear syntax 
			- Very few keywords 
		high-level -
			-its high level built in data structures combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding make it very attractive for rapid application development.
		
		interpreted language-
			-python is interpreted , object-oriented high level programing language with dynamic semantics.

2).History and evolution of Python. 
	->>  It is mainly developed for emphasis on code readability and its syntax allows programmer to express concept in fewer line of code.
	Reduce development time,code is 2-10x shorter than c,c++,java.
       		1991=python
       		2000=python 2
       		2008=python 3
       		2024=python 3.13.0   
      
3).Advantages of using Python over other programming languages. 
	->>python support modules and packages , which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
	->>Variable do not need declaration.
	->>Works Everywhere like as on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even mobile devices.

4).Installing Python and setting up the development environment (Anaconda, PyCharm, or VS Code). 
	->>
	Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
      	Download VS Code:
      	Visit the VS Code website and download it for your OS.
      	Install Python Extension:
      	Open VS Code.
      	Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
      	Search for "Python" and install the official extension by Microsoft.
      	Set up Python Interpreter:
      	Open any Python file or create a new one.
      	Click on the interpreter selection in the bottom-left corner and choose your installed Python version. 

5). 5)Writing and executing your first Python program.

       Open an text editor like as vscode.
       print("Hello World")
       Save the file with extension .py
