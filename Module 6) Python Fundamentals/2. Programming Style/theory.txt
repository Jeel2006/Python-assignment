1).Understanding Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 guidelines. 
1. File Naming:
   - Python files use `.py` extension.
   - Files run directly are **scripts**, and imported files are **modules**.

2. Code Style:
   - Indent with 4 spaces not tabs.
   - Use `snake_case` for variables/functions and `PascalCase` for classes.
- Keep lines under 79 characters.
--->
snake_case:Words are written in lowercase and separated by underscores (_).Commonly used for variables and function names.
Examples:
    total_count
    calculate_sum()
--->
3. Namespaces:
   - Each file/module has its own namespace.
   - Import with `import module_name`.

4. Program vs. Module:
   - A `.py` file run directly is a script.
   - The same file, when imported, acts as a module.


2).Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python. 
	1. single line comment(#)
	2. multi-line comment("""/ """) or docstrings(""")

Rebinding : variables can be reassigned to different objects during execution.
	x=41
	x=[1,2,3]
->> naming convention (it means declaring variables and identifiers)


Python Variable Naming Rules:

1. Must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
2. Cannot start with a number.
3. Can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _).
4. Case-sensitive (age, Age, AGE are different).
5. Cannot use Python keywords (e.g., if, while).


3).Writing readable and maintainable code.

	->>Follow PEP 8: Use 4-space indentation and descriptive names.
	Use Comments: Explain complex logic briefly.
	Keep Code Modular: Use functions and classes for reusability.
	Handle Errors: Use try-except for safe execution.
	Use Constants: Store fixed values in uppercase variables.
	Readable Outputs: Use f-strings for clarity.
