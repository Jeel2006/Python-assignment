1).Introduction to conditional statements: if, else, elif.
	-if: Checks a condition and executes the block if true.
	-elif: Checks another condition if the if condition is false.
	-else: Executes when all conditions are false.
if condition1:
    # Executes if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # Executes if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
else:
    # Executes if none of the conditions are true


2).Nested if-else conditions. 
	-A nested if-else places one if or else inside another for more complex decisions.

if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # Executes if both condition1 and condition2 are true
    else:
        # Executes if condition1 is true but condition2 is false
else:
    # Executes if condition1 is false

explanation:
	-Use if:For the first condition to be checked.
	-Use elif:For additional conditions, when the if condition is false.
	-Use else:For the fallback code when all conditions fail.
	-Nested if-else:Use it when a condition depends on another condition.
