1).Understanding data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.

	->>Understanding Data Types 
	- Integer:Whole numbers, positive or negative.  
	- Float: Numbers with decimal points.  
	- String:Sequence of characters.  
	-lists:Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
	-tuples:Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
	-dictionaries:Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
	-sets:Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

2).Python variables and memory allocation.
	->>Variables store data values and reference memory locations dynamically allocated during runtime.

3).Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.
	- Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations like +, -, *, //.  
	- Comparison Operators: Compare values, e.g., ==, !=, <, >.  
	- Logical Operators: Combine conditions using and, or, not.  
	- Bitwise Operators: Perform bit-level operations like &, |, ^, ~.
